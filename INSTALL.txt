------------------
-- Requirements --
------------------

First of all, the requirement to run this software is:
    * Django version 1.0 or greater.

    * The Python Imaging Library:
        * python-imaging package (on Debian or Ubuntu).
        * Source: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

    * Optional: the Google Data API (allows image searching)
      Download it from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

You can see a demo of which can be accomplished here:
    http://profile.elementales.com


-----------------
-- Quick guide --
-----------------

You can run the demo application supplied on this package on your own server to
make and idea of what can be accomplished with django-profile.
Follow these steps to make it run:

* Make django visible in your python path. You could import the last version
from the repository executing this command:
    $ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/django

* Make the "userprofile" module (supplied on this package) visible on your 
  PYTHONPATH.

* You need a valid e-mail server to try the e-mail validation process
  or password recovery utilities, and fill this information in the demo
  project 'settings.py' file:

# e-mail settings
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = ''
EMAIL_HOST = ''
EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''

If you want to use Gmail as the SMTP server, you can use these settings:
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = '<youraccount>@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = '<youraccount>@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '<yourpassword>'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True 
EMAIL_PORT = "587"  #this line may not be required.

* You also need a valid Google Maps API Key so your users can use the Google 
  Maps positioning functionality. Obtain one for your site name here:

    http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

  Put the obtained key in the constant GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY located in the demo
  project 'settings.py' file.

* OPTIONAL. If you want to use the Picasa search for avatars, put this variable
  on the demo project 'settings.py' file.

    AVATAR_WEBSEARCH = True

  Then, download and put on the PYTHONPATH the Google Data APIs. 
  This will allow your users to select avatars directly from Picasaweb:
    $ wget http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata.py-1.1.0.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf gdata.py-1.1.0.tar.gz

    Now move the gdata.py-1.1.0/src/gdata and gdata.py-1.1.0/src/atom 
    directories to your PYTHONPATH.

* Once everything has been configured, you can start the the "demo" application:

	$ python manage.py syncdb (this creates a sqlite database)
and
	$ python manage.py runserver

* You can now connect to the django web server and try the demo. 

	http://127.0.0.1:8000

-- Custom install guide --
--------------------------

Once you've seen what can be done with this pluggable application, you could 
integrate django-profile with your custom software. Basically, you need to:

* Create a Profile model which inherits from BaseProfile (defined on 
  userprofile.models). You can see an example on the demo project, named
  "demoprofile". Look at this code:

###############
from django.db import models
from userprofile.models import BaseProfile
from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
from django.conf import settings
import datetime

GENDER_CHOICES = ( ('F', _('Female')), ('M', _('Male')),)

class Profile(BaseProfile):
    firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    surname = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=GENDER_CHOICES, blank=True)
    birthdate = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today(), blank=True)
    url = models.URLField(blank=True, core=True)
    about = models.TextField(blank=True)
###############

You can define any attribute of information you want to store on the user 
profile.

* Define the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE variable of your 'settings.py' project file
  pointing to your new profile model class (remember, everything lowercase).
  For example, look at the 'settings.py' demo project definition:

    AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'demoprofile.profile'

* Add the new application and the 'userprofile' application to the 
  INSTALLED_APPS section of your 'settings.py' project file. For example:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'userprofile',
    'demoprofile',
)

* Include the urlpatterns of the 'userprofile' application to your project
  'urls.py' file. For example:

urlpatterns += patterns('',
    (r'^accounts/', include('userprofile.urls')),
)

* Copy the data of the "media" directory to your own "media" static serve of
  files. Look at the demo application to learn how can be accomplished this.

*  You can also customize the default templates supplied with the 'userprofile'
   application. Basically, two templates are the most propsense to customize:
   "userprofile/profile/personal.html" and "userprofile/profile/public.html"

   In "personal.html" template you could add your own widgets to make more 
   usable the introduction of information of your users. Look at the demo
   template customization of "personal.html" to get a tip of how to customize
   a date introduction, or a selectable info introduction.

*  Import in your html required css and js files (from your media directory) :
   *  userprofile/js/jquery-1.2.6.min.js
   *  userprofile/css/django-profile.css
   *  userprofile/css/django-profile-basics.css if you don't want to use blueprint

*  Add "userprofile.context_processors.css_classes" to your
   "TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS" in your "settings.py" file

------------------------
-- Settings variables --
------------------------
You can customize some of the behaviour of django-profile stablishing these
variables on your own project "settings.py" file:

* DEFAULT_AVATAR. It's the filesystema path to the default avatar image.  
  Normally, you will define it as "%MEDIAROOT%/avatars/generic.jpg".  If this 
  setting is not set, a default image will be copied to 
  "%MEDIAROOT%/userprofile/generic.jpg".
* I18N_URLS. If this setting is set to True, the application will try to use 
  internationalized urls. The language will be obtained from the LANGUAGE_CODE 
  setting variable, and must be a file named as this LANGUAGE_CODE on the 
  "userprofile/urls" directory.
* AVATAR_WEBSEARCH. If set to True, it will enable the Google Picasa web search
  of avatars.
* AVATAR_QUOTA. Max upload size (in MB) of the avatar image.
* GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY. If set to True, it will enable the geopositioning 
  utility on the user profile control panel.
* REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION. If set to True, the user e-mail will be required to
  get an account on the system.
* USERPROFILE_CSS_CLASSES. Specify which set of classes use for html structure 
  of django-profile. Are provided :
  - blueprint (the default, for blueprint css framework, full width) 
  - 960gs-12 (for 960.gs css framework, 12 columns, full width)
  - 960-gs-16 (for 960.gs, 16 columns, full width)
  - 960gs-12-in-9 (for 960.gs css, in a width of 9 columns, given as example)
  You can specify one of these, or a entire dict for your own classes (see
  context_processors.py to see all keys))

Examples:
I18N_URLS = True
DEFAULT_AVATAR = os.path.join(MEDIA_ROOT, 'avatars', 'generic.jpg')
DEFAULT_AVATAR_WIDTH = 96
AVATAR_WEBSEARCH = True
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "ABQIAAAA06IJoYHDPFMx4u3hTtaghxTpH3CbXHjuCVmaTc5MkkU4wO1RRhST5bKY_U7dUG1ZGu1S-n-ukXGNjQ"
REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION = True
USERPROFILE_CSS_CLASSES = 'blueprint'

** ADVANCED FEATURES **

Activate IP Localization:
-------------------------
* Install the GeoIP C Library and the Python ctypes library:
	apt-get install python-geoip
	apt-get install python-ctypes

* Download the geolitecountry and geolitecity binary databases:
	http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry
	http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
* Set the GEOIP_PATH on settings.py to the directory where the databases are stored:
	GEOIP_PATH = "%s/db/" % PROJECT_PATH

Custom templates and additional context variables
-------------------------------------------------
If you want to use your own templates instead of the provided ones, you would
like to have your own variables.
Each view send a signal named "context_signal" which have three parameters :
- "sender", the view which is sending the signal (the view, not a string)
- "request", the request object passed to the view
- "context", a dictionnary of context variables ready to pass to the template
You can connect to this signal for the view you want and update the context 
variables.

Here is an example where we define a new template variable named "my_var" for
use in our own template "userprofile/profile/public.html" (the "public" view)

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# in your application
def public_signal(sender, **kwargs):
    kwargs['context']['my_var'] = 'MY_VAR'

from userprofile import views as userprofile_views
from userprofile.signals import context_signal
context_signal.connect(public_signal, sender=userprofile_views.public)
#--------------------------------------------------------------


Custom actions and response after user input
--------------------------------------------
For each view which receive an input value, a signal is sent in order to
do what you want with request, form and other values, and to choose if you
want to replace the response originally provided by the view
Each of these view send a signal named "post_signal" which have four parameters :
- "sender", the view which is sending the signal (the view, not a string)
- "request", the request object passed to the view
- "form", the form object if the view has one
- "extra", an optional dictionary with values depending of the view :
   - "key" for "email_validation_process"
   - "newuser" for "register"
   - "response" for "email_validation_reset"

Here is an example where we do auto-login after registration and redirect to our own url

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# in your application
def register_signal(sender, **kwargs):
    newuser = kwargs['extra']['newuser']
    username = newuser.username
    password = kwargs['form'].cleaned_data.get('password1')
    from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
    user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
    login(request, user)
    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("our_own_url_name"))

from userprofile import views as userprofile_views
from userprofile.signals import post_signal
post_signal.connect(register_signal, sender=userprofile_views.register)
#--------------------------------------------------------------
